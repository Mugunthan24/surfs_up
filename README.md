The main differences in the weather temperature between June and December are:
- The average temperature in June is approximately 74.94°F while in December it was approximately 71.04°F
- The temperature in June has a standard deviation of 3.26 while in December it was approximately 3.75
- The highest temperature recorded in June was 85°F while in December it was 83°F
- The lowest temperature recorded in June was 64°F while in December it was 56°F

Based on the temperature results, it can be concluded that June is warmer than December but this difference is probably not drastic enough to significanly impact the sales at the surf and ice cream shop. The standard deviation is approximately the same in both June and December indicating that variations in temperature should be identical. The maximum and minimum temperatures recorded for each month are nearly the same as well. 

Additionally, the month of June has a total count of 647 days with no precipitation while the month of December has 510 days with no precipitation. December has more rainy days so we can possibly expect sales to go down slighly during this period.

Overall, it is possible to have a successful surf and ice cream shop business, but sales can be expected to drop slightly in December.
